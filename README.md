Horiseon Code Redo

## Description

Our client Horiseon, is a marketing agency that wanted their website to be more accessible for all users and wanted it to be more optimzed for search engines. 

I redid this project to meet the clients needs for accessibility standards.

I hope that I met all standards they required.

I learned that each element and image need an explanation for the needs of all users. Every user for every website should not have to wonder what the website is.
